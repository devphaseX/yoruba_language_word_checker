# Yoruba Language word checker
English is the dominant language in this industry; an increasing number of individuals are using computers globally.  Because English has taken over their functions, the Yoruba language is becoming less popular among its people.  The aim of this project is to develop a Yoruba spell checker that would detect and correct misspelled words.  The native tongue of the Yoruba people is spoken among other languages in Nigeria, Benin, and Togo and in communities in other parts of Africa, Europe and the Americans. 

 The Yoruba people originated from the western Nigeria and the places where the language is spoken are termed “ile Yoruba”, meaning the Yoruba land.  (wikipedia) It was recently revealed that native languages such as Yoruba were no longer being taught and spoken by individuals, particularly at home, and that those who did speak it made several errors.
